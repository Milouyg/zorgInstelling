# Assignment SolutionFactory

# Project Overview
In this README, you will find information about the assignment I received during my internship at SolutionFactory. The task was to create a Work-at website for a healthcare facility within a one-week timeframe.

# Requirements
I needed to consider the following aspects:

- Web design
- Contextual components
- Functional elements (although the functions do not necessarily need to be fully operational)
- Menu
  
Furthermore, I aimed to adhere as closely as possible to the following criteria:

- Responsiveness
- Compliance with digital accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1)
- Freedom to choose the technology stack

# Outcome
I implemented the code using Angular, striving to meet the specified requirements. I am pleased with the final result, and there is potential for additional features in the future.
